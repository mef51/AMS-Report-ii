\begin_layout Abstract
This report describes my second COOP term at the A.
 E.
 Lalonde Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Lab in the ARC building at uOttawa
 and details the topic of ion sources for use with accelerator mass spectrometry
 (AMS).
 I give a history of the development of ion sources and their design and
 then focus on cesium sputter ion sources, which are now widely used for
 AMS.
 I describe the parts of the cesium ion source and then talk about the problems
 we've encountered using it at the A.E.L.
 AMS lab.
 I then outline various designs and strategies for solving some of these
 problems.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Accelerator Mass Spectrometry is used to measure isotopes in a sample that
 would be otherwise difficult to detect-- or difficult to tell apart-- from
 more abundant isotopes.
 Examples include counting C14 atoms in a sample filled with C12 for radiocarbon
 dating, or counting U236 in a sample abundant with U238 to track nuclear
 fallout.
 The AMS machine accelerates ion beams using a tandem accelerator, and it
 is at these high energies that AMS is able to separate isotopes from each
 other using bending magnets and electrostatic analyzers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tandem accelerator works by applying a high positive voltage to the
 center of the beam pipe.
 The tandem tank at uOttawa applies 3 million volts, and other tandems can
 go up to 10 million volts.
 Negative ions formed in the ion source are accelerated towards the tandem,
 attracted to the high positive voltage.
 Once in the center of the tandem the electrons are stripped from the ions
 so that they become positive.
 These positive ions are now repelled from the high positive voltage and
 accelerated once again.
 The tandem technique uses the same field to accelerate ions twice by switching
 the charge on the ions at the center of the pipe.
 The reason this is done with negative ions that are then stripped of their
 electrons is because it is easier to strip electrons from fast-moving negative
 ions than it is to give electrons to fast-moving positive ions.
 The stripping of electrons is done by placing a foil or gas in the path
 of the anions.
 When the anions collide with the foil or gas electrons are stripped away.
 At uOttawa, argon gas is used as a stripper, but carbon foils can also
 be used.
 Thus the way the tandem works requires that for accelerator mass spectrometry
 negative ions must be produced.
